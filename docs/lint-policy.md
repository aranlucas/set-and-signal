# Lint policy

Oxforge owns the shared rules and their tests. This repository does not maintain
local lint-rule implementations or a separate vendor copy.

The strict, type-aware frontend check retains its scope and settings.
`lint:strict` also runs `lint:policy` across all owned web, backend, and build
JavaScript and TypeScript. This thin config imports the shared Oxforge rule maps
so Convex transactions and sequential build scripts keep their existing policy
without inheriting frontend-only restrictions. Agent assets remain excluded;
application source and tests are not blanket-excluded.

## Documented boundary exceptions

Per-line exceptions retain established contracts where changing a type or adding
a schema wrapper only to satisfy syntax would be misleading. Consumers still
validate domain fields. No `any` replacement or fabricated assertion was added.

- `parsePayload`, `payloadMessage`, `parseUser`: arbitrary server/account input
  immediately passes through its Valibot schema; existing normalized error text
  remains part of the contract.
- `parseCSV`, `parseWhen`, `parseWorkoutCSV`, `parseBodyweight`, `parseImport`:
  public import boundaries preserve accepted raw inputs and coercion, followed by
  their existing CSV/XML/date/domain checks. Internal cell helpers now use their
  actual string-cell contracts.
- `estimate1RM` load/repetition inputs and `clampToolNumber`: editable inputs are
  numerically coerced, checked for finite/range/cap constraints, and rejected or
  clamped before calculation. Normalizer exports use native schema parsers.
- The weight Slider callback validates the library's untyped scalar/array input
  before selecting a number. The Convex snapshot callback validates state before
  admitting it.
- `convex/model.ts`: heterogeneous forward-compatible persisted fields remain
  unknown through splitting/reassembly. The canonical serializer retains its
  object discrimination to avoid cloning values or changing property/getter
  evaluation and canonical conflict bytes. Collection IDs and mutation payloads
  are separately validated. Regression tests cover unknown fields, nested record
  metadata, prototype-named keys, omission versus null, stable key ordering,
  preserved collection order, and duplicate/invalid IDs.

## Test seams

Module replacements were removed. Convex tests inject a disabled real client and
spy only on instance operations, with explicit credential loading. UI tests use
real translation and router providers; the start chooser separates its store
container from a state-driven view. Browser globals use Vitest's scoped global
stubs and are restored. Existing persistence/concurrency/isolation tests remain.

The application Vitest config explicitly selects `test/**/*.test.*`.
